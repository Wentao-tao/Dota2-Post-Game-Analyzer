## API Integration

### OpenDota API
- **Base URL**: `https://api.opendota.com/api`
- **Endpoints Used**:
  - `/search` - Player search
  - `/players/{id}/recentMatches` - Recent matches
  - `/matches/{id}` - Detailed match data
  - `/heroes` - Hero information
  - `/constants/items` - Item data

### OpenAI API
- **Model**: GPT-4o
- **Usage**: Performance analysis and coaching advice
- **Estimated Cost**: ~$0.01-0.03 per analysis

## Performance Scoring Algorithm

### Overall Score Calculation
```
Overall Score = (
  Farming Efficiency Ã— 0.25 +
  Combat Performance Ã— 0.25 +
  Economy Score Ã— 0.20 +
  Itemization Score Ã— 0.15 +
  Map Awareness Ã— 0.15
)
```

### Grading System
- **S+ (90-100)**: Exceptional performance
- **S (85-89)**: Outstanding
- **A+ (80-84)**: Excellent
- **A (75-79)**: Very good
- **B+ (70-74)**: Good
- **B (65-69)**: Above average
- **C+ (60-64)**: Average
- **C (55-59)**: Below average
- **D+ (50-54)**: Needs improvement
- **D (0-49)**: Requires significant work

## Customization

### Adding New Metrics
